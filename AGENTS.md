# AGENTS.md

## Local overrides

If `AGENTS.local.md` exists at the repo root, read it and let its instructions take precedence over
this file. It is gitignored for personal, machine-specific preferences and never committed.

## Commands

`Taskfile.yml` wraps the common workflows — run `task --list` to see them. These are the only
entrypoints; never bypass them by calling scripts, tools, or `python` directly — the task and prek
layers manage the virtualenv, file selection, and flags.

- `task install` — sync the project and dev dependencies from the lockfile, then install the prek
  hooks.
- `task test` — run the test suite (append args after `--`, e.g. `task test -- -k name`; passing
  args disables coverage, since a subset run would fail the global coverage threshold).
- `task test:matrix` — run the suite on every supported Python version.
- `task check` — run every prek hook over all tracked and untracked files. Hooks that can fix
  (Ruff, dprint, markdownlint) rewrite files in place. Run before committing.
- To run a single hook: `uv run prek run <hook-id>` (e.g. `uv run prek run check-max-lines`). Hook
  IDs are in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- `uvx pymaxlines --show-sizes` — print a code-line breakdown of every file (largest first) instead
  of checking limits. Pass paths to scope it: `uvx pymaxlines --show-sizes src/heavy_module.py`.
  Use it to find the biggest files and functions before deciding where to split. Counts exclude
  blanks, comments, and docstrings — matching what the `check-max-lines` hook enforces.
- `task schemas` — regenerate `schemas/` and `docs/event-reference.md` from the pydantic record and
  event models. Run it after any change to a model field or docstring and commit the output; the
  drift test in `tests/event_docs/test_event_docs.py` fails on stale artifacts.
- `task clean` — remove build artifacts, caches, and virtualenvs.

## Git hygiene

- Never run `git commit --no-verify`, `git commit -n`, or anything else that skips the prek hooks —
  the hooks are the gate, not an obstacle.
- Fix a failing check at its source. Never edit a test to make it pass.

## Linter and type-checker configuration

Treat lint and type-check config as fixed. Never add to an ignore list, disable a rule, lower a
severity, or exclude a file to get a check passing — fix the code instead. A suppression is
warranted only when the finding is a genuine false positive or the rule cannot apply (e.g. a
generated file, a documented upstream bug); then suppress at the narrowest scope — an inline
directive with a reason — not in the shared config. When the same inline directive keeps recurring
for the same rule, that is a signal the rule may deserve a config-level ignore — propose it to the
user and wait for explicit approval; never promote a suppression into config on your own.

## Module layout

A line-count check caps a file's code lines and a function's. The cap marks a file that holds more
than one concern; it is not a budget. These rules decide where code lives. They are applied to the
letter: a reason that is not written here is not a reason. The numbers and names they refer to are
listed under Project facts.

A module's **importers** are the project modules that import it in any form: at module level,
inside a function, or under `TYPE_CHECKING`. Tests, `__main__.py` and `__init__.py` are not
importers. To **fold** a module is to move all of it into another module and delete the file.

**Registration is not use.** A module that only registers another (a command, a handler, a plugin)
and never calls it is neither its user nor its home, and does not count among its importers. A
module that nothing but its registrar imports is a module of its own at any size; one that other
modules also import is placed by those importers alone.

The **generic-helpers module** holds code that passes this admission test: it imports no project
module, names no project type, imports the standard library only, and would make sense pasted
unchanged into an unrelated repository.

1. **New code goes in the module that uses it.** One user: that module. No new file until rule 2
   or rule 6 calls for one.
2. **Shared code goes to its home.** When two or more modules use it, the first of these that
   applies:
   - It passes the admission test: the generic-helpers module.
   - One of its importers is already imported by every other importer: that importer is the home,
     because nobody loads the code without loading it. The home must use the code at runtime, and
     the fold must not turn another module's `TYPE_CHECKING` import of the home into a runtime
     import.
   - It is a rule about one project type (a predicate, a constructor, a conversion) and every user
     already imports the module that defines the type: beside the type. Code that merely mentions
     the type does not qualify.
   - Otherwise: a module of its own, named for what it does, whatever its size.
3. **A module that has a home folds into it.** A module with one importer folds into that
   importer. A shared module that passes the admission test folds into the generic-helpers module.
   Any other shared module whose importers satisfy the second test in rule 2 folds into that
   home. When several modules could fold into the same target and not all fit, fold the smallest
   first and stop before the first that does not fit. A module nothing in the project imports (a
   console-script target, a `python -m` target) stands.
4. **Only three things block a fold**, and each one can be checked:
   - **Size.** The target would land above the fold limit, summing the code lines of every file
     that goes into it. The fold limit sits below the cap so that a fold is not undone by the next
     edit. A file may grow past the fold limit afterwards; only the cap forces a move.
   - **Layer.** Code stays in the layer its subject belongs to, even when every caller is in
     another layer. A module whose only importer is in another layer stands in its own. The
     generic-helpers module belongs to no layer.
   - **Seam.** A seam test would fail after the fold. A seam without a test is a preference: write
     the test first if the property matters.

   None of these block a fold: "it is a distinct concern", "it is pure logic", "it is easier to
   test alone", "it is one of several alike", "reusable later", "keeps the importer small",
   "matches the existing small modules". Small modules already in the tree are debt, not
   precedent: report one that has a home and no block, and fold it when asked.
5. **Never pool.** Merging two modules when neither imports the other is pooling, whatever the
   file count gained. A module's name says what everything in it does; a name that fits only
   because it is wide (`helpers`, `common`, `shared`, `core`, `misc`) marks a pool. The
   generic-helpers module is the one exemption from both sentences: the admission test, not its
   name, decides what belongs in it, and it obeys the cap like any file. Asked to consolidate,
   apply rule 3 until nothing more folds and report every other module with the block or the lack
   of a home that keeps it.
6. **At the cap, move one whole concern**: the code least tied to the rest that changes together
   for one reason. It goes to a new module named for what it does, or to an existing module you
   have read that already owns that concern. The file must land at or below the fold limit; if it
   does not, pick a different, larger concern. Never move just enough to pass, never top up the
   move with unrelated code, and never compress code to fit. The module carved out stands for as
   long as folding it back would exceed the fold limit.
7. **A package is a directory of modules that each stand under these rules.** Its `__init__.py`
   holds no code beyond a docstring. When folding leaves a package with one module, the package
   becomes that module.
8. **One import path per name.** Import a name from the module that defines it. An `__init__.py`
   re-exports nothing, and a module's `__all__` lists only names it defines.

### Project facts

- **Cap:** `check-max-lines` allows 500 code lines per file and 60 per function.
- **Fold limit:** 450 code lines.
- **Layers:** `cli/` holds code about the command line itself: flag parsing, exit routing,
  terminal display, the wiring and guarding of commands. Everything else is outside it.
- **Seam test:** a test that starts a fresh interpreter and asserts which modules are, or are not,
  in `sys.modules`.
- **Generic-helpers module:** `utils.py`.

## Docstrings

Google style. Private functions need none. A one-line docstring has no sections; a longer one has
every section that applies — `Args:` whenever the function takes parameters. Beyond what it raises
directly, `Raises:` lists every error that propagates from a callee and that its callers are
expected to handle. An error a callee may raise that no caller handles stays out (an `OSError` from
a file call).

- Prose never restates what a section says.
- A function you edit gets its docstring brought to this shape, even if you did not write it.
- Tests: no docstrings on test functions; every fixture gets a one-line docstring.

## Spelling (cspell)

Treat a cspell failure as a prompt to reword, not to grow the dictionary. Prefer plain words in
prose and identifiers. A word earns a `cspell.json` entry only when it comes from outside the
project and cannot be renamed — command names, API identifiers, file formats, proper nouns, domain
vocabulary (e.g. `addopts`, `conftest`, `pyrefly`). In tests, never invent gibberish that needs a
suppression — any real word works for an unknown command, a bogus flag, or filler data, so pick one
(`banana`, not an invented pseudo-word). `# cspell:disable-line` is reserved for fixtures where the
gibberish itself is the behavior under test, never a dictionary entry.
